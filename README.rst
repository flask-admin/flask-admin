Introduction
------------

This is a library for building an administrative interface on top of the Flask framework.

Flask-Admin comes with a few batteries included: model scaffolding for `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_,
`MongoEngine <http://mongoengine.org/>`_ and `Peewee <https://github.com/coleifer/peewee>`_ ORMs as well as a simple file management interface.

You're not limited by the default functionality - instead of providing simple scaffolding for the ORM
models, Flask-Admin provides tools that can be used to construct administrative interfaces of any complexity,
using a consistent look and feel.

Documentation
-------------

Flask-Admin is extensively documented, you can find `documentation here <http://readthedocs.org/docs/flask-admin>`_.

3rd Party Stuff
---------------

Flask-Admin is built with the help of `Twitter Bootstrap <http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>`_ and `Select2 <https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2>`_.

Kudos
-----

Some ideas were taken from the `Flask-Admin <https://github.com/wilsaj/flask-admin-old>`_ by Andy Wilson.
